# Project_Button

Project Button is born on the eve of Thanksgiving. The mission seeks to respond to the emergency situation of having visiting relatives over for the holiday. Stylish, enduring, endearing, dysfunctional buttons that lack executability are perfect solutions that answer to such sticky circumstance. By replace the button names with the names of your relatives, you can push them away as a form of metaphorical retaliations against their attempted attacks or infrigements on privacy during the happy holiday get-together
